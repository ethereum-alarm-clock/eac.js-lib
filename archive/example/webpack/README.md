# Example Scheduling Page

_Beware: This app does no verifcation on the inputs and currently only works
with block based scheduling._

Navigate inside this directory (example/webpack/) and run:

```
npm i
```

Then:

```
npm start
```

Open your browser to `localhost:3000`. Make sure to have
MetaMask installed and unlocked for the __Ropsten__ network.
