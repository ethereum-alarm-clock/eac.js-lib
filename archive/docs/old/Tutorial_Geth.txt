If you would like to test the Ethereum Alarm Clock on the Rinkeby tesnet,
you will have to run a Geth node. This tutorial will breifly walk you through
how to set up a node from scratch and get it up and working with the EAC.

First you will have to download the latest Geth binary. You can acquire the 
binary for your system from Geth's official download page here. (https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/)

Then you will want to start up the node in fast mode if this is your first time syncing. 
Starting in fast mode will greatly reduce the time it takes your node to catch 
up with the current head of the blockchain.

```
geth --rinkeby -- fast --cache=512 --rpc console
```

After you sync up with the chain you will want to create a new account by telling 
geth to look for the rinkeby datadir, like so:

```
geth account new --datadir ~/.ethereum/rinkeby 
```

This is the default location for the rinkeby testnet data on linux machines,
on other systems it might be different. If you need help finding it, look in 
the Geth documentation for the default data directory for your operating system.

Now we need to get some funds to use the EAC. The easiest way to get some rinkeby 
ether is through the official faucet at https://faucet.rinkeby.io/.

Once we have some ether in our account we can create and fund a new light wallet.
